# Electricity Demand Forecasting Project

**A look into using machine learning to assist with electric grid forecasting and resilience**
This repository includes the report and Jupyter notebook used to make day-ahead forecasts for electricity demand. This project uses 2018-2021 electric demand  data obtained through EIA and was performed as part of the Springboard program.
