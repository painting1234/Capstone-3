Model Metrics for Predicting Electricity Demand 24-hours ahead using Time-Series Models

Models explored: ARIMA, ARIMAX, and Facebook Prophet model. 
The focus is on ARIMAX.

Parameters:
model = SARIMAX(y, exog, order=(4,1,3), enforce_stationarity=False)
-y is the electricity demand timeseries.
-The "exog" argument is forecasted temperature data.
-The order parameters were chosen using lowest BIC value for "AR" & "MA", and KPSS test for "I".

Metrics:
Model forecast accuracy was assessed with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
MAPE = 0.0781355930219362

MAPE is assessed across 20 separate 24-hour forecasts. The training sets and 24-hour forecast horizons were all randomly chosen using TimeSeriesSplit().
